# Angular Landing Template (SSR + Prerender)

Modern Angular 22 starter template for building fast landing pages with **SSR prerendering**, **TailwindCSS**, and **GitHub Pages deployment**.

This template is optimized for static landing sites where pages are rendered at **build time** for SEO and performance.

---

# Acknowledge

- Angular **22**
- **SSR prerendering** during build
- **Zoneless Angular**
- State used in HTML class bindings should be exposed as **signals**
- Prefer **Angular Signal Forms** as the primary forms approach when building new forms
- **OnPush change detection through Angular 22 defaults**
- **TailwindCSS v4**
- Use shared **theme CSS variables** from `src/styles/_theme.scss` for colors, surfaces, spacing, radius, and motion
- **GitHub Pages deployment**
- **Prettier formatting**
- Clean minimal project structure

The project builds both:

```
dist/app/browser
dist/app/server
```

But deployment uses the **browser prerendered output**, making it perfect for static hosting.

---

# Project Structure

```
src/
  app/
    app.component.ts
    app.config.ts
    app.config.server.ts
    app.routes.ts
    app.routes.server.ts
    layouts/
    pages/
  assets/
  environments/
  i18n/
  styles/
  styles.scss
```

SSR configuration lives in:

```
app.config.server.ts
app.routes.server.ts
```

---

# Development

Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

or

```
ng serve
```

Application runs at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Development mode runs as a normal Angular SPA.

---

# Build

Build the project:

```
npm run build
```

This generates:

```
dist/app/browser
dist/app/server
```

Pages are **prerendered at build time** using Angular SSR.

---

# Running the SSR server (optional)

After `npm run build`, the generated SSR server can be run manually:

```
node dist/app/server/server.mjs
```

For most landing pages this is **not required**, because prerendered HTML is already generated.

---

# Prerender configuration

All routes are prerendered by default:

```
src/app/app.routes.server.ts
```

```
RenderMode.Prerender
```

```ts
export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
	{
		path: '**',
		renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
	},
];
```

This makes Angular generate static HTML for every route during build.

---

# Bootstrap Data

The app includes a small bootstrap data flow for company profile data.

Main files:

```text
src/app/app.config.ts
src/app/feature/bootstrap/bootstrap.service.ts
src/app/feature/bootstrap/bootstrap.interface.ts
src/app/feature/company/company.data.ts
src/app/feature/company/company.service.ts
src/data/company/company.json
src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

How it works:

- `APP_INITIALIZER` runs `BootstrapService.initialize()` during app startup
- on the server, bootstrap data is fetched from `${environment.apiUrl}/api/regionit/bootstrap/${environment.companyId}`
- fetched data is stored in Angular `TransferState`
- on the browser, transferred data is applied immediately and then refreshed in the background
- if no remote data is available, the app falls back to `src/data/company/company.json`
- local company data is normalized into a `CompanyProfile` with SEO defaults, contact fields, structured data, and page SEO overrides

Bootstrap payload shape:

```ts
export interface BootstrapData {
	company?: Partial<Company> | null;
}
```

Environment keys involved:

- `apiUrl` - API host used for bootstrap requests
- `companyId` - company identifier sent to the bootstrap endpoint

Current fallback behavior in code:

- when the API is unavailable, the app keeps rendering with local fallback company data
- when the API returns a partial company object, it updates identity fields without discarding local SEO/contact defaults

This keeps SSR and prerender safe while still allowing the app to hydrate with API data when it exists.

For future component or page-level async reads, prefer signal-based resources. Use `ngxResource()`
from `@wawjs/ngx-core` for persisted or generic async reads, especially when `StoreService` caching
is useful. Keep bootstrap initialization, migrations, and startup fallback flows as direct
imperative async code when a resource state object would make the flow less clear.

For theme preferences, keep mode, density, radius, and persistence centralized in `ThemeService`
from `@wawjs/ngx-ui`. Do not add duplicate `localStorage` or document attribute logic for theme
state in app components.

---

# TailwindCSS

Tailwind is configured via:

```
.postcssrc.json
```

Tailwind should be used as much as possible for everyday UI work.

Prefer Tailwind utilities for:

- layout
- spacing
- typography
- colors
- borders
- sizing
- responsive behavior

Use SCSS only when Tailwind is not the right tool, for example:

- component-specific complex styling
- shared design tokens and mixins
- advanced states or selectors
- small amounts of global styling

Global styles live in:

```
src/styles.scss
```

---

# Icons

This template includes **Material Symbols Outlined** and those should be used as the default icon set across the project.

Loaded in:

```
src/index.html
```

Use icons directly in HTML like this:

```html
<span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">arrow_forward</span>
```

For accessible buttons, keep the icon decorative and provide a text label or `aria-label` on the button itself:

```html
<button type="button" aria-label="Open menu">
	<span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">menu</span>
</button>
```

---

# Translations And Languages

UI translations live in:

```text
src/i18n/<code>.json
```

Language metadata lives in:

```text
src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

Translation bootstrap starts in:

```text
src/app/app.config.ts
```

The app uses the `@wawjs/ngx-translate` translation stack:

- `provideTranslate(...)` registers the default interface bundle from `/i18n/`
- `TranslateDirective` and `TranslateService` are the default translation primitives
- Ukrainian is the default language and root source text
- `src/i18n/ua.json` is the root source array; every other language file is an array in the same order

When adding or updating translations:

- add or update the matching `src/i18n/<code>.json` array
- update `environment.languages` when adding or renaming a supported language
- keep Ukrainian source text identical across templates, components, and `src/i18n/ua.json`
- keep every translated language array aligned by index with `src/i18n/ua.json`
- store translation text and language labels as real UTF-8 characters, not escaped or re-encoded mojibake
- remove unused source strings from every language array when they are no longer referenced anywhere in the app

Supported usage patterns:

- Use the `translate` directive for plain element text content
- Use `TranslateDirective` for text and translated attributes
- Use `[translate]="{ placeholder: 'Default source text' }"` for directive-managed translated attributes
- Use `TranslateService.translate('Default source text')()` in TypeScript when the translated value is needed inside `computed()` or composed strings
- Do not use `TranslatePipe`; it is not available in the current `@wawjs/ngx-translate` package

Examples:

```html
<span translate>Default source text</span>
<button translate [translate]="{ ariaLabel: 'Default aria label' }" type="button"></button>
```

```ts
private readonly _translateService = inject(TranslateService);

protected readonly toggleLabel = computed(() =>
	this._translateService.translate('Default source text')(),
);
```

---

# SCSS Conventions

Use SCSS in a way that matches modern Angular defaults:

- Keep most styles inside the component `.scss` file.
- Use `src/styles.scss` only for truly global styles like resets, tokens, typography, and utility layers.
- Prefer CSS variables for colors, spacing, and theming that may change at runtime.
- Use SCSS features like `@use`, mixins, and partials for authoring convenience and shared design tokens.
- Avoid deep selector nesting. Keep selectors simple and local to the component.
- Avoid `::ng-deep` and `ViewEncapsulation.None` unless there is a clear integration reason.
- Prefer class bindings in templates over heavy inline style bindings.

Recommended split:

```text
src/styles.scss           -> global entry point
src/app/**/**/*.scss      -> component-local styles
src/styles/_theme.scss    -> shared theme CSS variables
```

---

# Environments

This template includes Angular environment files and they can be used for different runtime setups such as local development and production builds.

Available files:

```text
src/environments/environment.ts
src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

Typical use cases:

- API base URLs
- feature flags
- analytics toggles
- external service configuration

Production builds replace `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts` through Angular file replacements.

Keep environment files limited to public front-end configuration. Do not store secrets in them.

---

# Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically via **GitHub Actions**.

Workflow:

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

Steps:

1. Install dependencies
2. Build Angular app
3. Copy `CNAME`
4. Push build output to `gh-pages`

The deployed folder is:

```
dist/app/browser
```

---

# Domain

Custom domain which you should adjust to your own domain so it works properly, any subdomain of `*.itkamianets.com` in case it's not used before on our github org.

```
ngx.itkamianets.com
```

Configured via:

```
CNAME
```

---

# Code Style

Formatting is handled by:

- `.editorconfig`
- `.prettierrc`

Key conventions:

- **tabs**
- **single quotes**
- **100 character line width**

---

# AI Usage

If you use AI outside the IDE and it does not automatically read repository instructions, copy the
contents of `AGENTS.md` into the AI prompt/context first.

This ensures the AI follows the same project-specific rules that Codex uses inside the IDE.

---

# MCP Servers For Codex, Copilot, And Gemini

This project uses these MCP servers:

```toml
[mcp_servers.angular-cli]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@angular/cli", "mcp"]

[mcp_servers.context7]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

[mcp_servers.typescript-lsp]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "ts-lsp-mcp", "serve", "--stdio"]
```

Use the following setup depending on the client.

## Codex

Codex supports both user-level config and repo-level config through TOML files:

- global: `~/.codex/config.toml`
- project-local: `.codex/config.toml`

Codex CLI and the Codex IDE extension share the same MCP configuration.

### Codex global config

Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.angular-cli]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@angular/cli", "mcp"]

[mcp_servers.context7]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

[mcp_servers.typescript-lsp]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "ts-lsp-mcp", "serve", "--stdio"]
```

### Codex project-local config

Create `.codex/config.toml` in the repository root and add the same block:

```toml
[mcp_servers.angular-cli]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@angular/cli", "mcp"]

[mcp_servers.context7]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

[mcp_servers.typescript-lsp]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "ts-lsp-mcp", "serve", "--stdio"]
```

If Codex does not load project-local MCP config, mark the repo as trusted in your user config:

```toml
[projects.'\\?\C:\Users\YOUR_USER\work\itkp.ngx-default']
trust_level = "trusted"
```

### Codex CLI commands

You can add the same servers with the CLI instead of editing TOML manually:

```bash
codex mcp add angular-cli -- npx -y @angular/cli mcp
codex mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
codex mcp add typescript-lsp -- npx -y ts-lsp-mcp serve --stdio
```

Useful checks:

```bash
codex mcp --help
codex mcp list
```

## GitHub Copilot

For GitHub Copilot in VS Code, MCP servers are configured with `mcp.json`:

- global: your VS Code user MCP config
- project-local: `.vscode/mcp.json`

The project-local file is the easiest way to share MCP setup with everyone working in the repo.

### Copilot project-local config

Create `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
	"servers": {
		"angular-cli": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@angular/cli", "mcp"]
		},
		"context7": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
		},
		"typescript-lsp": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "ts-lsp-mcp", "serve", "--stdio"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Copilot global config

Open the Command Palette in VS Code and run:

```text
MCP: Open User Configuration
```

Then add the same JSON shown above.

You can also use:

```text
MCP: Add Server
```

and choose either `Workspace` or `Global`.

### Copilot notes

- On Windows, these MCP servers run as local processes through `npx`.
- After saving `mcp.json`, use `MCP: List Servers` to verify they started.
- If your team uses Copilot CLI separately, its MCP config is different and lives in `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`.

## Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI supports both user and project scope through `settings.json`:

- global: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- project-local: `.gemini/settings.json`

### Gemini global config

Add this to `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"angular-cli": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@angular/cli", "mcp"]
		},
		"context7": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
		},
		"typescript-lsp": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "ts-lsp-mcp", "serve", "--stdio"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Gemini project-local config

Create `.gemini/settings.json` in the repo root and add the same JSON:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"angular-cli": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@angular/cli", "mcp"]
		},
		"context7": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
		},
		"typescript-lsp": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "ts-lsp-mcp", "serve", "--stdio"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Gemini CLI commands

Gemini CLI can write either scope directly:

```bash
gemini mcp add -s user angular-cli npx -y @angular/cli mcp
gemini mcp add -s user context7 npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
gemini mcp add -s user typescript-lsp npx -y ts-lsp-mcp serve --stdio
```

```bash
gemini mcp add -s project angular-cli npx -y @angular/cli mcp
gemini mcp add -s project context7 npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
gemini mcp add -s project typescript-lsp npx -y ts-lsp-mcp serve --stdio
```

Useful checks:

```bash
gemini mcp list
```

## Recommendation

For this repository:

- use `.codex/config.toml` if your team uses Codex
- use `.vscode/mcp.json` if your team uses Copilot in VS Code
- use `.gemini/settings.json` if your team uses Gemini CLI

Use global config only when you want the same MCP servers in every project.

```
npm run build
```

# Requirements

Recommended environment:

```
Node.js 20+
npm 11+
```

# Code structure guide

## Pages

Application pages should be created inside:

```text
src/app/pages/
```

Each page should have its own folder and its own component file.

Example:

```text
src/app/pages/home/home.component.ts
src/app/pages/about/about.component.ts
```

Generate a page component with Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate component pages/home
```

or shorter:

```bash
ng g c pages/home
```

Pages should be lazy loaded from `src/app/app.routes.ts`.

Example route config:

```ts
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

export const routes: Routes = [
	{
		path: '',
		loadComponent: () => import('./pages/home/home.component').then((m) => m.HomeComponent),
	},
	{
		path: 'about',
		loadComponent: () => import('./pages/about/about.component').then((m) => m.AboutComponent),
	},
];
```

---

## Feature structure for back-end connected modules

If a part of the app needs its own business logic and back-end integration, create a dedicated feature folder inside:

```text
src/app/feature/
```

Each feature should keep its own internal structure.

Example:

```text
src/app/feature/user/
src/app/feature/user/components/
src/app/feature/user/directives/
src/app/feature/user/interfaces/
src/app/feature/user/pages/
src/app/feature/user/pipes/
src/app/feature/user/services/
```

Example service location:

```text
src/app/feature/user/services/user.service.ts
```

Suggested CLI commands:

Create feature page:

```bash
ng g c feature/user/pages/user-profile
```

Create feature component:

```bash
ng g c feature/user/components/user-card
```

Create feature directive:

```bash
ng g d feature/user/directives/user-focus
```

Create feature pipe:

```bash
ng g p feature/user/pipes/user-name
```

Create feature service:

```bash
ng g s feature/user/services/user
```

Interfaces are usually created manually:

```text
src/app/feature/user/interfaces/user.interface.ts
src/app/feature/user/interfaces/user-response.interface.ts
```

For small focused features, colocated files like `feature/language/language.type.ts`,
`language.interface.ts`, `language.const.ts`, and `language.service.ts` are also valid when that
structure keeps the feature simpler.

---

## Generic shared code

Generic reusable code that is not tied to one specific feature can live directly under `src/app`.

Example shared folders:

```text
src/app/components/
src/app/directives/
src/app/interfaces/
src/app/pipes/
src/app/services/
```

Example shared pipe location:

```text
src/app/pipes/phone.pipe.ts
```

Suggested CLI commands:

Create shared component:

```bash
ng g c components/page-header
```

Create shared directive:

```bash
ng g d directives/autofocus
```

Create shared pipe:

```bash
ng g p pipes/phone
```

Create shared service:

```bash
ng g s services/api
```

Interfaces are usually created manually:

```text
src/app/interfaces/api-response.interface.ts
src/app/interfaces/select-option.interface.ts
```

---

## Development summary

Use these locations by default:

- `src/app/pages` - app-level lazy loaded pages
- `src/app/feature/<name>` - feature-specific code with back-end/business logic
- `src/app/components`, `directives`, `pipes`, `services`, `interfaces` - generic shared code

# Create a new project from this template

Clone the default repository into a new folder with your project name (replace `PROJECT_NAME` with your project name):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volyn-it-space/ngx-default.git PROJECT_NAME
cd PROJECT_NAME
npm i
npm run start
```

### What these commands do

- `git clone https://github.com/volyn-it-space/ngx-default.git PROJECT_NAME`
  Downloads the template repository and creates a local folder named `PROJECT_NAME`.
- `cd PROJECT_NAME`
  Opens the newly created project folder.
- `npm i`
  Installs all project dependencies from `package.json`.
- `npm run start`
  Starts the local development server.

After that, open the local URL shown in the terminal, usually [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Initialize your own git repository

If you want to start fresh instead of keeping the template git history, remove the existing `.git` folder, initialize a new repository, and create the first commit.

Example:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/volyn-it-space/PROJECT_NAME.git
git add .
git commit -m "chore(init): bootstrap project from ngx-default template"
```

`git remote add origin ...` connects your local repository to the remote GitHub repository so future `git push` and `git pull` commands know where your main project lives.

Use a Conventional Commit message for the first commit as well. A good default is:

```text
chore(init): bootstrap project from ngx-default template
```

# Adapting The Template To A Real Business

After cloning and installing the project, use the **Angular Default Web Art Work** Custom GPT to
adapt the template to a real business:

**[Angular Default Web Art Work on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6a205f0f0f14819185cd7707523d3816-angular-default-web-art-work)**

The GPT operates in two phases:

**Phase 1 — Implementation prompt**
Provide a Google Maps place URL and the new domain. The GPT researches the business from public
sources (Maps, website, socials, reviews, directories), gathers confirmed facts, and outputs one
compact ready-to-run prompt for a coding agent. The coding agent applies branding, content, SEO,
theme, company data, and environment config in a single pass.

**Phase 2 — Page cleanup**
After Phase 1 is applied, trigger cleanup with phrases like "cleanup" or "remove unused pages".
The GPT reviews each page one at a time, suggests keep or remove based on the business type,
collects your decision, and generates a targeted removal prompt.
